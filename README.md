# chex-datamining
This is the dataminer of chex!


How it works? We uses discord webhooks to send the commits that happens in our private server, then our discord bot fetchs the owner,repo,the commit sha, and finally the parent sha.
then it grabs every file edited, it find's the diff of the changed stuff. and sends it to our datamining webhook
